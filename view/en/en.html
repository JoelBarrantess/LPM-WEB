            <p class="quien">Introducing the Monthly Laptop Foundation, an NGO that aims to provide free access to technology and digital education to everyone, regardless of their financial means. The open library is a kind of virtual library, where people can come and use our laptops and our facilities at no cost. But in order to have a proper control of the users and to offer exclusive benefits to the most frequent members, we have established ourselves as a non-profit society and offer the opportunity to become a member for free.</p>
            <p class="quien">Registered members will be able to access our facilities more frequently and use our resources for educational or leisure activities. We believe that technology and digital education are essential tools for social inclusion and improving people's quality of life, and we are dedicated to making this possible for everyone.</p> 
            <p class="quien">The foundation also offers various educational programs and workshops for the community, in order to promote digital literacy and help people develop their technological skills. This includes programs for youth, adults and seniors, as well as specialized programs for people with disabilities or other special needs.</p>
            <p class="quien">In addition to access to technology and digital education, the foundation also provides other services and resources to the community. This includes the provision of books, magazines and other educational and reference materials, as well as free Wi-Fi network services and other technology resources. We also partner with other organizations and institutions to provide additional services and resources to the community.</p>
